# BeamSearch and Greedy Heuristic implementation 
- This is a simple implementation of BeamSearch and Greedy Heuristic AI bots to a Tetris Game made in Vanilla JavaScript made by Jake Gordon.
- Attached, are the default files stats.js and texture.png and my changed version of index.html that introduces the 2 bots. 
This implementation is part the Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures Course at Constructor University.
